a) 
There are 86,400 (60 x 60 x 24) seconds in a day, and 1 billion seconds equals
to around 11,574.07 (1,000,000,000 / 86,400) days. Assuming the moment I say
the  sentence is at the beginning of the day which is 00:00, the day I was born
would be 11,575 days ago. So, if today is Monday, 11,575 days ago would
be (11,575 = 1,653 x 7 + 4) Thursday.
